# Simple 3D Software Renderer

A lightweight **software renderer** written in **C++** that can load and render 3D models in [Wavefront](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file) format `.obj` files without relying on GPU APIs like OpenGL or DirectX.  
This project is designed as a learning exercise in computer graphics, rasterization, and 3D math.
